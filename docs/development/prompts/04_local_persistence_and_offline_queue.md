# Phase 4 — Local persistence and offline queue

Use this prompt only when Phase 4 is the current phase.

## Execution prompt

```text
You are implementing ONLY Phase 4 — Local persistence and offline queue of bug_gps.

Goal:
Prevent temporary connectivity failures from causing complete loss of driver location events.

Before changing code, read:
- .agent/Agents.md
- docs/product/context.md
- docs/product/product_spec.md
- docs/architecture/architecture.md
- docs/engineering/techstack.md
- docs/engineering/security.md
- docs/engineering/testing.md
- docs/development/Setup.md
- docs/development/build.md
- docs/development/implementation_plan.md
- docs/development/implementation_tracker.md
- docs/development/prompts/SYNC.md
- docs/development/prompts/REVIEW.md

Also read these phase-specific documents:
- architecture.md
- api_contract.md
- security.md
- testing.md
- observability.md
- implementation_tracker.md

First inspect:
- git status
- current source tree
- relevant existing implementation
- previous phase status and exit gate

Do NOT begin if the previous phase is not verified. If the previous phase is broken, use docs/development/prompts/RECOVERY.md first.

Phase scope:
- durable local location records
- pending/sent/failed state
- bounded queue
- retry with backoff
- idempotency metadata
- restart recovery
- safe retention limits

Explicitly forbidden in this phase:
- Supabase schema changes
- realtime student UI
- ETA
- push notifications

Implementation requirements:
1. Make the smallest coherent change that satisfies the phase.
2. Preserve existing architecture and frozen technologies.
3. Add or update tests with the feature.
4. Handle relevant success, denial, unavailable, stale, duplicate and failure states.
5. Do not add speculative abstractions.
6. Do not introduce a new dependency unless the dependency rule is satisfied and documentation is updated.
7. Do not change database migrations already applied.
8. Do not hard-code secrets or environment credentials.

Expected verification:
- insert/read
- process restart
- offline period
- reconnect flush
- duplicate suppression
- queue maximum
- corrupt record handling

After implementation:
1. Run targeted automated tests.
2. Run typecheck/lint/build checks affected by the change.
3. Perform the manual acceptance test(s), on real Android hardware where applicable.
4. Record exact commands and outcomes in docs/development/build.md.
5. Run docs/development/prompts/SYNC.md.
6. Run docs/development/prompts/REVIEW.md as an independent check.
7. Update docs/development/implementation_tracker.md using evidence only.
8. If an intentional architecture or technology decision changed, create/update docs/architecture/adr.md before declaring completion.

Phase exit gate:
A temporary network outage does not stop local tracking and queued events survive process restart and retry safely.

STOP after Phase 4. Do not start Phase 5.

Final response must contain:
PHASE RESULT

- Files changed:
- Tests executed:
- Manual verification:
