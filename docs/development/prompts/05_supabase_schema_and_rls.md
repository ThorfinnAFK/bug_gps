# Phase 5 — Supabase schema and RLS

Use this prompt only when Phase 5 is the current phase.

## Execution prompt

```text
You are implementing ONLY Phase 5 — Supabase schema and RLS of bug_gps.

Goal:
Create the secure relational backend foundation from reproducible migrations.

Before changing code, read:
- .agent/Agents.md
- docs/product/context.md
- docs/product/product_spec.md
- docs/architecture/architecture.md
- docs/engineering/techstack.md
- docs/engineering/security.md
- docs/engineering/testing.md
- docs/development/Setup.md
- docs/development/build.md
- docs/development/implementation_plan.md
- docs/development/implementation_tracker.md
- docs/development/prompts/SYNC.md
- docs/development/prompts/REVIEW.md

Also read these phase-specific documents:
- database.md
- api_contract.md
- security.md
- testing.md
- deployment.md
- implementation_tracker.md

First inspect:
- git status
- current source tree
- relevant existing implementation
- previous phase status and exit gate

Do NOT begin if the previous phase is not verified. If the previous phase is broken, use docs/development/prompts/RECOVERY.md first.

Phase scope:
- schools/users/roles
- buses/drivers/routes/stops
- trips
- live location records
- indexes and constraints
- seed/demo data
- RLS policies
- authorization tests

Explicitly forbidden in this phase:
- mobile UI
- ETA algorithm
- push notification implementation

Implementation requirements:
1. Make the smallest coherent change that satisfies the phase.
2. Preserve existing architecture and frozen technologies.
3. Add or update tests with the feature.
4. Handle relevant success, denial, unavailable, stale, duplicate and failure states.
5. Do not add speculative abstractions.
6. Do not introduce a new dependency unless the dependency rule is satisfied and documentation is updated.
7. Do not change database migrations already applied.
8. Do not hard-code secrets or environment credentials.

Expected verification:
- clean migration apply
- seed
- student cannot access another school
- driver cannot impersonate another driver
- unauthorized location write rejected
- invalid state rejected

After implementation:
1. Run targeted automated tests.
2. Run typecheck/lint/build checks affected by the change.
3. Perform the manual acceptance test(s), on real Android hardware where applicable.
4. Record exact commands and outcomes in docs/development/build.md.
5. Run docs/development/prompts/SYNC.md.
6. Run docs/development/prompts/REVIEW.md as an independent check.
7. Update docs/development/implementation_tracker.md using evidence only.
8. If an intentional architecture or technology decision changed, create/update docs/architecture/adr.md before declaring completion.

Phase exit gate:
The backend can be recreated from migrations and authorization tests prove tenant/role boundaries.

STOP after Phase 5. Do not start Phase 6.

Final response must contain:
PHASE RESULT
- Goal achieved:
- Files changed:
- Tests executed:
- Manual verification:
- Documentation updated:
- Known limitations:
- Exit gate: PASS/FAIL
- Commit:
