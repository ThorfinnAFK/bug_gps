# Phase 15 — Production release candidate

Use this prompt only when Phase 15 is the current phase.

## Execution prompt

```text
You are implementing ONLY Phase 15 — Production release candidate of bug_gps.

Goal:
Produce a reproducible signed Android release candidate.

Before changing code, read:
- .agent/Agents.md
- docs/product/context.md
- docs/product/product_spec.md
- docs/architecture/architecture.md
- docs/engineering/techstack.md
- docs/engineering/security.md
- docs/engineering/testing.md
- docs/development/Setup.md
- docs/development/build.md
- docs/development/implementation_plan.md
- docs/development/implementation_tracker.md
- docs/development/prompts/SYNC.md
- docs/development/prompts/REVIEW.md

Also read these phase-specific documents:
- deployment.md
- Setup.md
- build.md
- security.md
- testing.md
- implementation_tracker.md

First inspect:
- git status
- current source tree
- relevant existing implementation
- previous phase status and exit gate

Do NOT begin if the previous phase is not verified. If the previous phase is broken, use docs/development/prompts/RECOVERY.md first.

Phase scope:
- release configuration
- signing
- versioning
- environment separation
- production config validation
- AAB/APK generation
- install/update verification

Explicitly forbidden in this phase:
- new product features
- architecture redesign

Implementation requirements:
1. Make the smallest coherent change that satisfies the phase.
2. Preserve existing architecture and frozen technologies.
3. Add or update tests with the feature.
4. Handle relevant success, denial, unavailable, stale, duplicate and failure states.
5. Do not add speculative abstractions.
6. Do not introduce a new dependency unless the dependency rule is satisfied and documentation is updated.
7. Do not change database migrations already applied.
8. Do not hard-code secrets or environment credentials.

Expected verification:
- clean release build
- install
- upgrade
- login
- background tracking
- realtime
- ETA
- notifications
- crash reporting
- no secrets in artifact

After implementation:
1. Run targeted automated tests.
2. Run typecheck/lint/build checks affected by the change.
3. Perform the manual acceptance test(s), on real Android hardware where applicable.
4. Record exact commands and outcomes in docs/development/build.md.
5. Run docs/development/prompts/SYNC.md.
6. Run docs/development/prompts/REVIEW.md as an independent check.
7. Update docs/development/implementation_tracker.md using evidence only.
8. If an intentional architecture or technology decision changed, create/update docs/architecture/adr.md before declaring completion.

Phase exit gate:
A release build can be generated from documented instructions and passes the complete release checklist on at least two real Android devices.

STOP after Phase 15. Do not start Phase 16.

Final response must contain:
PHASE RESULT
- Goal achieved:
- Files changed:
- Tests executed:
- Manual verification:
- Documentation updated:
- Known limitations:
- Exit gate: PASS/FAIL
